# Sunflower
This is a short game for Windows about hidden disabilities that I made to practice Java. 
It's a bit complicated to figure out how it works, but not as much as it is to figure out how this life works when you're neurodivergent.

Open the game Sunflower.jar

If it doesn't work, install jdk-20_windows-x64_bin.exe and try again 
(you can download it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQBN6P1RH450SXqjnHvz6Oxti1_FLtWl/view?usp=sharing 
I'm totally trustworthy MY INTENTIONS ARE PURE I'M A GOOD HUMAN or I do my best anyway, like I rly try. 
Even if that sounds like sth a non-good human would say. 
Oh well, you can also go find it in some oracle page like-)
